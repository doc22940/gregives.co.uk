During my third year of university, I undertook a module on the Internet of Things. As part of this module, we were tasked to create a piece of firmware for the [unPhone](https://unphone.net/the-unphone/).

> The unPhone is an IoT development platform from the University of Sheffield, Pimoroni and BitFIXit that builds on one of the easiest and most popular networked microcontrollers available, the ESP32.

With my lab partner, we decided to create a TV remote using the unPhone, capable of controlling many different models of televisions. The TV remote had an interface similar to most traditional TV remotes and haptic feedback.
