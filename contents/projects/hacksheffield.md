The first hackathon I attended was HackSheffield 2.0, less than a month after I started university --- I had a fantastic time at the event, making <nuxt-link to="/projects/hype">an Android app called Hype</nuxt-link>, so I decided to become more involved with hackathons and in particular, HackSheffield society.

# Organising HackSheffield

HackSheffield is a society at the University of Sheffield dedicated to organising hackathons and sending members of the society across Europe to attend other hackathons. After HackSheffield 2.0, I joined the organising committee for HackSheffield, which at the time consisted of five Computer Science students. The first hackathon I organised was Local Hack Day 2016, coordinated by [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io).

I was elected President of HackSheffield from 2017 -- 2018 and Technical Officer from 2018 -- 2019. As such, I have worked with and led a team of now 14 people to organise our 24-hour hackathons HackSheffield 3, 4 and 5.

# Hackathons I've Attended

I've attended loads of hackathons since starting university. I decided to compile this map to showcase my hackathon travels! You can also see some of the projects I've created at hackathons [on Devpost](https://devpost.com/gregives).
