I have been a member of the University of Sheffield Brass Band for three years, and decided to create a website for them to promote concerts, news and photos. Check out the website at [usbb.org.uk](https://usbb.org.uk)!

An essential requirement of the brass band's website was that people with only a little technical experience would be able to edit it, or even people who had no prior experience. Therefore, Jekyll seemed a perfect static site generator for the job as future members of the band could edit the website simply by editing or adding markdown files.

I designed the website using Bootstrap and some custom styles, nothing too fancy! The contact form uses [formcarry](https://formcarry.com), a free backend for static forms.
