I completed my dissertation as part of my 3^rd^ year of university. Entitled "A Computer Vision System for a Chess-Playing Robot", my dissertation aimed to infer the state of a chessboard from a webcam placed above the board. Computer vision and machine learning are both fields of computer science which interest me, but in which I had little prior experience --- I learnt a huge amount over the course of researching, developing and writing my dissertation including OpenCV, scikit-learn, machine learning techniques and image processing techniques.

> Computer vision is the field of computer science which attempts to gain an understanding of the content within a digital image or video. Since its conception in the late 1960s, it has been used for a huge range of applications, from agriculture to autonomous vehicles. The aim of this project is to design a computer vision system to be used by a chess-playing robot, capable of detecting opponents' moves and returning the best move to be played by the robot. The system should be robust to changes in perspective, lighting and other environmental factors so that it can be used in any reasonable setting.

> This report researches existing computer vision systems for chess, comparing the methods they use and the constraints placed on them. New techniques are then explored, with the aim of creating a system which performs well under minimal constraints. The computer vision system is designed, implemented and evaluated in the course of this report.
