description: Why I decided to use a CMS for my website and why I chose to use Forestry.io

I'm writing this blog post on my phone and when I'm finished I'll click save, which will automatically trigger a build of my website. I think that's really cool! A few months ago, I didn't see the appeal in content management systems â€” in this blog post I'm going to explain why I've changed my mind and why I decided to use Forestry.io on my website.

## Why Use a Content Management System?

In my opinion, a content management system is used to abstract the content of a website away from the code. Before I started using a CMS, everything was all squished together in a Git repository, so when I wanted to make a new blog post, I would open up Visual Studio Code and create a new Markdown file for the blog post. Now I've started using a CMS, everything is still inside the repository (more on that later) but I now write new content on Forestry.io, which provides me with an online dashboard _designed purely for my content_.
