I'm a **final-year Computer Science student** at the University of Sheffield. This summer I interned at [FinancialForce](https://financialforce.com). I'm a lead instructor at [Code First: Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk) and a teaching assistant at the University of Sheffield. *I'm looking for an opportunity in software development from June 2020 --- check out my work or contact me!*
